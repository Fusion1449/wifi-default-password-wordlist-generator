### **WiFi Default Password Wordlist Generator**  

This script generates a wordlist based on default WiFi passwords used by some ISPs (Internet Service Providers), such as Vivo and Claro, in Brazil. These providers often use default passwords derived from the MAC address or network name. The tool creates combinations that can be useful for network security testing (e.g., password cracking, auditing) on networks where default passwords are still in use.

### **How It Works**  

- **Vivo Network**:  
  - The script asks for the MAC address of the Vivo network.  
  - It then generates a wordlist by creating variations of the MAC address (in uppercase and lowercase), along with combinations of two-character prefixes.  

- **Claro Network**:  
  - The script asks for the network name of the Claro network.  
  - It then extracts a portion of the network name (characters 8 to 14) and creates a wordlist with combinations of two-character prefixes.

### **How to Use**  

1. **Clone this repository:**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wifi-default-password-wordlist-generator.git](https://github.com/Fusion1449/wifi-default-password-wordlist-generator/
   ```  

2. **Install Python** (if not already installed):  

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```  

3. **Run the script:**  

   ```bash
   python generate_wordlist.py
   ```  

4. **Provide Input:**  
   - Select the ISP (Vivo or Claro) when prompted.  
   - Provide the required information (MAC address for Vivo or network name for Claro).  

5. **Wordlist Output:**  
   - A wordlist file will be created: `wordlist_vivo.txt` for Vivo or `wordlist_claro.txt` for Claro.

### **Using the Wordlists for Brute Force**  

The generated wordlists can be used in brute force password attacks on WiFi networks with tools designed for WPA/WPA2 cracking. These tools allow you to test each password in the wordlist against the target network. If the default password for the network is in the generated wordlist, the tool will eventually discover it.  

**Important:** This method is most effective on networks still using default passwords. It's essential to note that brute force attacks can take significant time depending on the size of the wordlist and the complexity of the password.  

**Reminder:** Always have explicit permission before conducting any security tests. Unauthorized use of this script is illegal and unethical.

### **Use Case**  

This script is useful for:  
- **Penetration Testing:** Identify weak default passwords.  
- **Network Audits:** Verify that networks use strong, unique passwords.  
- **Learning:** Understand common patterns in ISP-generated default passwords.
